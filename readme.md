# Classification of Tweets from Northern Europe

Across the globe, social media has become an integral part of the average person's life. There are apps for posting pictures, finding romantic partners, and sharing passing thoughts. In fact, social media has made it so easy share opinions that many people are more forward with their political views than ever before. Additionally, politicians have also taken to social media platforms such as Twitter to share their ideologies and grow their following.

This project aimed to investigate tweets posted by Northern European politicians in order to train a model that would then be able to predict the political leanings of any tweet. After a few iterations and improvements, the final model was able to predict a Twitter user's political views with approximately 77.7% accuracy.
